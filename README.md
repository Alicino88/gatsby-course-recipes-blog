I am diving for the first time into Gatsby and this code I have written and commented while following the Udemy course "Gatsby V3 Tutorial and Projects Course" by John Smilga.
Topics handled inside the code are:
- Gatsby plugin image (StaticImage and GatsbyImage components)
- Gatsby source filesystem
- Graphql (Static query and Page query)
- Environmental variables
- Gatsby plugin react helmet for SEO
- Gatsby plugin styled components
- Gatsby plugin webfonts
- Contentful as a headless CMS
